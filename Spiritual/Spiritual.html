The presiding deity is formless (Atmanatar); there is no Śivalingam but only a pedestal (Āvudayār) located in the sanctum, hence the name Avudayar Koil.The God faces South in this temple- in Dakshinamurthy or Guru form. His consort is worshipped as Śivayoganāyaki (Yogāmbāl) in iconless form. 
There is no Nandi bull icon as is conventional in almost all Shiva temples. <br>

            	The Brahmapureeswarar Temple is located in Thirupattur near Trichy, Tamilnadu, India.

<h3>Main deity </h3>
Brahma and Lord Shiva
<h3>History </h3>
The god Brahma's overwhelming pride as the Creator of the Universe. Brahma felt that He was more prevailing than Shiva – since He had the supremacy of creation.
This sense of pride provoked Shiva, who destroyed Brahma’s Fifth Head, and also cursed Him that He would lose His power of creation.
To relieve himself of this curse, Brahma started out on a pilgrimage of Shiva Temples.
During the course of His pilgrimage, Brahma also visited this temple and installed 12 Shiva Lingams around Brahmapureeswarar and worshipped Shiva here for a considerable time.
Being moved by Brahma's prayers, Shiva, on Devi Parvathi’s appeal, gave him Darshan under the Magizha tree and liberated Him from His curse. Shiva also restored the power and responsibility of creation to Brahma.
Shiva also blessed Brahma that He would have a separate shrine at this temple. He also advised Brahma that since Brahma himself had His destiny rewritten here; He should rewrite the destiny of His devotees visiting this temple.

<h3>Main deity </h3>
Goddess Vekkali Amman
<h3>History </h3>
The central shrine of the temple houses the image of Vekkali Amman and the major feature of the temple is the absence of roof over the sanctum. 
The roof over the sanctum was constructed during different times, but is believed to be burnt by the power of Vekkali Amman. The position of the leg of Vekkali Amman is different from other Shakti temples without roof where the right leg is placed over demon. As per Hindu legend, the position requires lot of energy and while Nataraja, during his dance switched his legs, Vekkali Amman remained in the position to show her energy levels. The posture is also believed to signify kindness, love, affection and compassion to her devotees. Historically, temples facing north, are considered to provide victories on endeavours. The Cholas worshipped the deity before proceeding to military campaign. The people of Woraiyur see Vekkali Amman as the saviour deity during difficult times.
