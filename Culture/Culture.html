            	<h2> Sittanavasal Cave Paintings </h2>
            	Sittanavasal Temple-cave was originally attributed to Pandya King Mahendravarman-I (580–630 AD). Sittanavasal caves are like Ajanta and Bagh caves.
The paintings include a pond with lotuses, bulls, elephants, apsaras(angels), and other gods.
There are seventeen polished stone berths following each other in a row. These stones are of great importance as there are inscriptions in Brahmi scripts on them from the first century BC.

            	<h2> Bhavani Jamakkalam </h2>
            	In Bhavani, a community of weavers called Jangamars weaved a type of blanket using colored coarse threads called Jamakkalam

Two types of jamakkalams are produced in Bhavani. The first type is made from coarser cotton threads capable of producing carpets with colored bands. As the thread was coarser, designs could not be weaved on to this type of carpet. Hence, a second softer variety of jamakkalams were introduced that were made of artificial silk threads enabling weavers to weave different kinds of border designs. Jamakkalams are also used to make fashion products such as backpacks.

                <h2> Kanchipuram Sarees </h2>
                As per legends, Kanjivaram silk weavers are the descendants of Sage Markanda, the master weaver of God. Many centuries later, his descendants settled in the small town of Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, and continued to weave silk with bold, vibrant colors like their ancestors.
When the weavers of Kanchipuram weave sarees, they weave a sacred textile that is hoped to bring happiness, health, and prosperity to the user.
In a genuine Kanchipuram Silk Sari, body and border are woven separately and then interlocked together. The joint is woven so strongly that even if the saris tears, the border will not detach.
